    <h2 style="color: #F1C40F">CONCLUSION:</h2><br>
    <p>The main aim of picking this dataset for visualization was to help a user understand the sale patterns on Black Friday. The visualizations would help the user figure out patterns and help him/her in analyzing the data easily. The following trends were observed on the basis of the visualization: <br>
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record"></span> The amount of money spent in different states in comparison to each other.  <br>
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record"></span> The different types of target audiences in the states and the usual spending habits of the different types of people. <br>
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record"></span> Which items are more popular in which state and are generally bought in relation to each other.  <br>
      These types of visualizations can be used by shops to figure out which products to stock up on and how to market them according to people's needs and will help boost their sales.
